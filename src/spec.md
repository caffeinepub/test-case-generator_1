# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix garbage text appearing in test case titles by improving the backend test case generation logic.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the test case generation logic in main.mo to produce clean, descriptive, and meaningful titles
- Ensure all test case titles contain only valid, readable text without placeholder content or garbage characters
- Implement consistent, professional naming conventions for test case titles
- Verify that titles accurately reflect their corresponding test scenarios and requirements

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see properly formatted, meaningful test case titles that clearly describe what is being tested, without any corrupted text or placeholder content.
