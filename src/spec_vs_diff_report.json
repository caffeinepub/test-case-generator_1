  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to the backend test case generation logic in main.mo, updating the title format from a simple description to a more structured format using the type prefix. However, the implementation still generates generic, template-based titles rather than semantically meaningful titles based on the actual requirement content. The frontend components have been updated to display the title field, but the core issue of generating meaningful, requirement-specific titles is not fully addressed.",

      "id": "REQ-17",
      "requirement": "Ensure all test case titles are clean, descriptive, and meaningful without any garbage characters, placeholder text, or non-descriptive content",
      "reason": "The updated title generation still produces generic, template-based titles like 'Functional Test: [requirement]' that concatenate the type with the requirement text. While this removes some garbage text, it does not ensure truly descriptive, meaningful titles that clearly describe what is being tested in a professional naming convention. The titles are simply prefixed concatenations rather than intelligently generated descriptions.",

      "id": "REQ-18",
      "requirement": "Verify that test case title generation produces semantically meaningful names that accurately reflect the test scenario based on the input requirements",
      "reason": "The title generation logic uses a simple concatenation pattern (type_ # ' Test: ' # req) which does not produce semantically meaningful names tailored to each test scenario. All functional tests get 'Functional Test: [req]', all boundary tests get 'Boundary Test: [req]', etc. This is generic templating rather than semantic generation that would produce distinct, scenario-specific titles for different test types testing the same requirement.",
